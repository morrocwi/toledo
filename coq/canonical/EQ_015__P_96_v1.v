   evidence for this reading cites readout_universe's discrete
   Lagrange-d'Alembert forced master theorem (evidence/DRL_Forced_Master.v,
   the EQ-015 trunk equation's own Coq proof) as the general
   discrete-mechanics construct this reading is claimed to specialize from.
   It is NOT a literal Coq restatement of this entry's own statement above --
   no closure of the statement as written is claimed here. What is genuinely
   proved and imported below is the cited theorem itself: for any NoDup node
   list, any symmetric graph weight W, any per-node heterogeneous
   M/D/K2/J/eta, at any node k, the central-difference stationarity of the
   force-augmented discrete action is algebraically equivalent (over Q, no
   approximation) to the full forced master-equation recurrence at that node
   -- Closed under the global context, 0 axioms, per readout_universe's own
   verify_report.json (quoted, not asserted). *)

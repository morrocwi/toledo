(* ShakeIrrational.v
   Th_coqc-tier claim, axiom-free over Z: the specific integer that arises as the
   SHAKE-constraint discriminant numerator (for the pivot-bob1 rigid-rod constraint of
   the double pendulum in exact_q_double_pendulum.py's initial condition, first Verlet
   step) is NOT a perfect square. Combined with the standard classical fact "a positive
   integer that is not a perfect square has an irrational square root" (cited, not
   re-derived here -- flagged Dr, not Th_coqc), this justifies the concrete claim that
   this simulation's SHAKE Lagrange multiplier lambda is irrational for this step --
   the central design reason (stated in prose in exact_q_double_pendulum.py's docstring)
   for using a penalty spring instead of SHAKE to stay closed over Q.

   delta_num was computed exactly in Python (fractions.Fraction) as the numerator of
     Delta = (r1free . d)^2 - (|r1free|^2 - 1)
   for r0=(0,0), r1=(3/5,-4/5), v1=(0,0), m1=1, g=981/100, tau=1/4000, l1^2=1,
   d = r1 - r0 (the SHAKE bond direction), r1free = r1 + v1*tau + (1/2)*(0,-g)*tau^2.
   See the journal for the full derivation.
